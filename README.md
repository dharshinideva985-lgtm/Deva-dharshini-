ShopEase, Human ReadMe

Overview

ShopEase is a straightforward e-commerce demo website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases essential online shopping features like product listing, wishlist, cart, and checkout without any frameworks or backend systems.

Project Structure

This project has three main files:

  ->nm.html. This file contains the main HTML structure of the website.

  ->nm.css. This file handles all the visual styling and responsive design.

  ->nm.js. This file manages the website's logic, such as adding items to the cart, wishlist, and filtering products.

How It Works

  When you open the HTML file in a browser, you can see a sample shopping site called ShopEase. The homepage shows various products along with details such as name, description, price, and rating.

You can:

  Search for products using the search bar.

  Filter items by category or sort them by price and rating.

  Add products to your wishlist to save them for later.

  Add items to your cart and proceed to checkout.

  Fill out your details in the checkout form to simulate an order.

This project operates entirely on the client side, so there is no backend connection or data storage between sessions.

Design Details

  The site features a modern, minimal design using the Montserrat font.

  All layouts are responsive and adjust to smaller screens.

  Hover and transition effects enhance the smoothness of interactions.

  Each product card is neatly arranged using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

How to Run

To view the project:

  Download all three files (nm.html, nm.css, and nm.js) and keep them in the same folder.

  Open the nm.html file in any modern web browser.

  You can now interact with the demo shop.

  No installation or extra setup is needed.
